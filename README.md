**Assignment 2 Report: Practical Implementation of Git for Collaborative Development**

## Overview
This project documents all of the steps taken by our group to develop, integrate, test, and release features during Assignment 2 using Git and GitHub. Each team member was assigned a specific role, contributing to the successful development of several features, branch management, conflict resolution, and quality control. Below, we detail the teamâ€™s workflow, the process of resolving conflicts, the roles of each member, and the implementation of Git version control.

## Role Assignment
- **Master branch and final releases manager (Lead Integrator):** Lucas
- **Develop branch and quality control manager (Development Integrator):** Gael
- **Feature 1 Developer (Feature 1 Lead):** Carlos
- **Feature 2 Developer (Feature 2 Lead):** Nicky
- **Hotfix and maintenance manager (Maintenance and Hotfix Manager):** Albert
- **Advanced testing and project verification (QA and Final Verification):** Victor

## Our Workflow History

### STEP 0: GitHub Repository Implementation
- **Lucas** created the initial GitHub repository and performed the following:
  - Added repository name and description.
  - Cloned the repository: `git clone URL`.
  - Created a README file and added it to the main branch: `touch README.md`.
  - Made initial commits and pushed the main branch: 
    ```
    git commit -m "A: Initial creation of main branch with README.md"
    git push origin main
    ```
  - Created the `develop` branch to begin feature development:
    ```
    git checkout -b develop
    git push origin develop
    ```

---

### STEP 1: Feature Development
- **Carlos and Nicky** developed their respective features:
  - Checked out the `develop` branch and created feature branches for development:
    ```
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b featureX
    git push origin featureX
    ```
- **Carlos** implemented Feature 1:
  - Created and implemented `file1_feature1.py`:
    ```
    touch file1_feature1.py
    git add file1_feature1.py
    git commit -m "C: Start of feature 1 implementation"
    ```
  - Finalized implementation and pushed Feature 1:
    ```
    git add file1_feature1.py
    git commit -m "D: Final implementation of feature 1 with some bugs"
    git push origin feature1
    ```
- **Gael** managed the merging process:
  - Merged Feature 1 into the `develop` branch:
    ```
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge origin/feature1 -m "E: Merging feature1 into develop"
    git push origin develop
    ```
- **Nicky** worked on Feature 2:
  ```
  touch file1_feature2.py
  git add file1_feature2.py
  git commit -m "F1: Start of feature 2 implementation"
  git push origin feature2
  ```

---

### STEP 3: First Release (v1.00)
- **Gael** prepared for the first release:
  - Created a release branch and made final adjustments:
    ```
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git checkout -b release1
    touch file_release1.py
    git add file_release1
    git commit -m "G: Final Adjustments for release v1.00"
    git push origin release1
    ```
- **Lucas** merged release 1 into `main` and tagged it as version 1.00:
  ```
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git merge origin/release1 -m "H: Release v1.00"
  git push origin main
  git tag -a v1.00 -m "v1.00: First release"
  git push origin v1.00
  ```

---

### STEP 4: Bug Fixing
- **Albert** created a hotfix branch to fix critical bugs in Feature 1:
  ```
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -b hotfix1
  git add file1_feature1.py
  git commit -m "K: Fixing the bug in file1_feature1.py"
  git push origin hotfix1
  ```
- **Lucas** merged the hotfix into `main` and tagged it as version 1.01:
  ```
  git checkout main
  git merge hotfix -m "L: Merging hotfix to file1_feature1.py"
  git tag -a v1.01 -m "Version 1.01: Hotfix for file1_feature1.py"
  git push origin main
  git push origin v1.01
  ```

### STEP 7: QA and Final Verification

**15. VICTOR (Advanced Testing and QA)**
- Victor, responsible for QA and final verification, started by cloning the repository to ensure the latest version of all branches and commits:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/LucasEscayola/A2G07.git
  cd A2-G7
  ```
- Switched to the `main` branch and pulled all tags:
  ```
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git fetch --tags
  ```
- Reviewed the commit history and overall workflow:
  - Used the following commands to check consistency and order:
    ```
    git log
    git log --oneline
    ```
- **Advanced Testing**:
  - Performed advanced testing for conflicts and bugs using the following steps, creating unittests for each feature:
  
  **Unittest for Feature 1**:
  - Created `test_feature1.py` to validate the division function, ensuring proper input handling:
    ```python
    import unittest
    import utils

    class TestUtils(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_division_valid(self):
            self.assertEqual(utils.division(10, 2), 5)
            self.assertEqual(utils.division(-6, 2), -3)

        def test_division_zero_division(self):
            with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):
                utils.division(10, 0)

        def test_division_invalid_input(self):
            with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
                utils.division("10", 2)
            with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
                utils.division(10, "2")
    ```

  **Unittest for Feature 2**:
  - Created `test_feature2.py` to validate character counting in strings:
    ```python
    import unittest
    import utils

    class TestUtils(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_count_string(self):
            self.assertEqual(utils.count_string("Chicken dinner"), 13)
    ```

  **Unittest for Feature 3**:
  - Created `test_feature3.py` to test additional functionalities added in Feature 3:
    ```python
    import unittest
    import utils

    class TestDivisionValid(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_division_valid(self):
            self.assertEqual(utils.division(10, 2), 5)
            self.assertEqual(utils.division(-6, 2), -3)
    ```

  **Running the Tests**:
  - Ran the unit tests to confirm the validity and integration of all features:
    ```
    python -m unittest test_feature1.py
    python -m unittest test_feature2.py
    python -m unittest test_feature3.py
    ```

Victor ensured that all the tests were successfully completed, confirming that all features were well integrated and the project was ready for final delivery.

## Conclusion
During this project, our team gained practical experience in using Git and GitHub for effective collaborative development. We structured our branch management, implemented features, and tested extensively using `unittest`. We faced challenges such as merge conflicts and branch mismanagement, which we overcame by communicating as a team and following best practices.

We hope that this repository serves as a demonstration of our efforts in applying Git techniques and collaborative workflows to build a well-structured project.
